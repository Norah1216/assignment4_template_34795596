## Data Origin

Source: United Kingdom Office for National Statistics (ONS) – local area statistics

Original File: datadownload.ods, an OpenDocument Spreadsheet containing multiple sheets of data

Tables Used:
Table 5: Modelled unemployment rate (percentage) for years 2017–2023
Table 61: Average life satisfaction score (scale 0–10) for years 2017–2023

Data Characteristics: These indicators are derived from sample surveys (not a full census). The unemployment rates are modelled estimates from survey data, and life satisfaction scores come from a well-being survey. As such, values are estimates subject to sampling variability (they are not exact counts).
